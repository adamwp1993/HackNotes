# Tips

1. Always clean up after yourself - if any code or files have been left on servers, passwords changed, etc. Keep in mind many Metasploit exploits will drop files and payloads on systems. They typically will attempt to clean themselves up, but pay close attention because this may fail. Keep detailed notes of:&#x20;
   1. Exploited systems (hostname/IP and method of exploitation)
   2. Compromised users (account name, method of compromise, account type (local or domain))
   3. Artifacts created on systems
   4. Changes (such as adding a local admin user or modifying group membership)
2. When using web shells, use non standard file names and parameter names, use web shells with password protection or possibly limited to your IP address to avoid drive-by attackers.&#x20;
3. When using tools such as metasploit, its always good to understand what the exploit or module is doing under the hood so you can troubleshoot and understand what is failing if it does not behave as expected. sometimes custom scripts might require some minor modifications, specific tools may not work in certain scenarios although the exploit you are attempting is a valid path. So if one fails, try to understand the why, dive a bit deeper and attempt the same thing but in a different way.
