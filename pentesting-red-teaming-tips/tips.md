# Tips

1. Always clean up after yourself - if any code or files have been left on servers, passwords changed, etc. Keep in mind many Metasploit exploits will drop files and payloads on systems. They typically will attempt to clean themselves up, but pay close attention because this may fail. Keep detailed notes of:&#x20;
   1. Exploited systems (hostname/IP and method of exploitation)
   2. Compromised users (account name, method of compromise, account type (local or domain))
   3. Artifacts created on systems
   4. Changes (such as adding a local admin user or modifying group membership)
2. When using web shells, use non standard file names and parameter names, use web shells with password protection or possibly limited to your IP address to avoid drive-by attackers.&#x20;
